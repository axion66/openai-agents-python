"""
Example demonstrating how to use the reasoning content feature with the Runner API.

This example shows how to extract and use reasoning content from responses when using
the Runner API, which is the most common way users interact with the Agents library.

To run this example, you need to:
1. Set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
2. Use a model that supports reasoning content (e.g., deepseek-reasoner)
